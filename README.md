# Automatic-Certificate-Generator-
This project 'AUTOMATA CERTIFICATE GENERTATOR USING PYTHON AND OPENCV'  implements a classic version  of a certificate generator. This certificate genrator includes two .txt.files one for name of the candidates with  date and other for the co-ordinates . First we have to provide name in the name.txt.file and then co-ordinates to  the co- ord.txt.files. After all this we will run the python code and it will fetch all the details from these  .txt.files  and will generate our certificates
